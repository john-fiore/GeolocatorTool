# Geolocator Tool
This is a simple geolocating app that I wrote in Python to familiarize myself with the `requests` library and the [ipinfo API](https://ipinfo.io/).

All it does is print out your current location, IP, and timezone for you - it does ***not*** collect your info.

**Do note:** This will only work as intended on Windows operating systems, as the clear function is not compatible with other operating systems like MacOS and Linux.

I also don't really intend on updating this, as the code is fairly readable and should be easy enough to modify on your own. However, if you *really* want me to update it, [shoot me an email](mailto:johnfthedev@gmail.com).
